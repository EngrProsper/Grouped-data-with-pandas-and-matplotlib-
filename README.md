# Grouped Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python project that analyzes sales data from a CSV file by grouping it by region. The script processes a dataset with columns for Date, Product, Units Sold, Revenue (USD), Region, and Customer Age Group. Using pandas, it aggregates revenue and units sold per region, while matplotlib creates a dual-axis bar chart to visualize these metrics. The project also exports the grouped data to an Excel file with an embedded chart using openpyxl, aiding in better decision-making through organized data analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `openpyxl`

Install them via pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl
##How to run
1. Clone the Repository:
Use Git: git clone https://github.com/prosperochu/Grouped-prosperochuandas-and-matplotlib.git
Or download the ZIP and extract it.
Open the Notebook:
Open data_grouping.ipynb Jupyter Jupyter NotebooGoogleoogle Colab (recommended link: CColab Link).
Ensure the freelance_project.csv file is in the same directory (included in this repo).
Execute the Code:
Run all cells to generate the grouped data, chart, and Excel file (project_grouped_data.xlsx).
The script automatidownloadsnloads the Excel file with an embedded chart.
