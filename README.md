Grouped Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib
Project Overview
This repository contains a Python project that analyzes sales data from a CSV file by grouping it by region. The script processes a dataset with columns for Date, Product, Units Sold, Revenue (USD), Region, and Customer Age Group. Using pandas, it aggregates revenue and units sold per region, while matplotlib creates a dual-axis bar chart to visualize these metrics. The project also exports the grouped data to an Excel file with an embedded chart using openpyxl, aiding in better decision-making through organized data analysis.
Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
openpyxl
Install them via pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl
How to Run
Clone the Repository:
Use Git: git clone https://github.com/prosperochu/Grouped-data-with-pandas-and-matplotlib.git
Or download the ZIP and extract it.
Open the Notebook:
Open data_grouping.ipynb in Google Colab (recommended link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14bwT_xp6XVVeVI-GfP0MfienimpmBYtk#scrollTo=Yc-DdLEXnrVJ).
Ensure the freelance_project.csv file is in the same directory (included in this repo).
Execute the Code:
Run all cells to generate the grouped data, chart, and Excel file (project_grouped_data.xlsx).
The script automatically downloads the Excel file with an embedded chart.
Results
Data Grouping: The script groups data by Region, summing Revenue (USD) and Units Sold, and lists unique Customer Age Groups.
Visualization: A dual-axis bar chart displays Revenue (red) and Units Sold (blue) per region, with age group annotations above each bar.
Excel Output: The grouped data is exported to project_grouped_data.xlsx, including a header, note, and an embedded chart for easy sharing.
Sample output (from the chart):
North America: High revenue (~$8,000) and units (~400).
Europe, Asia, South America: Varying metrics with age groups like 18-24 to 55+.
